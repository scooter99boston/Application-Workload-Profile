# Application-Workload-Profile
The Application Profile Workload Project (the "Project") is a project of the Linux Foundation. The purpose of the Project is to define an industry standard definition for application workload profiles and a standard set of measures and metrics that represent those profiles with the goal of developing an open source QA standard that replicates the above. The project may also develop a set of standardized tests that will validate and qualify platforms and infrastructure, which support the applications characterized by the profiles. These profiles will be represented as a set of Meta-Data elements that would describe the platform resource throughput requirements, security, regulatory, compliance, geographic constraints (risk) and financial objectives that a given application workload needs to operate within.  Finally, the Meta-Data model ideally would also capture technical and operation dependencies, constraints, relationships and hierarchy that the application workloads operates within.

Contribution to, and participation in, the Project is pursuant to the terms of the Project's Technical Charter (the "Charter"), which can be found in the CHARTER.MD file.
