# Application-Workload-Profile
The Application Profile Workload Project (the "Project") is a project of the Linux Foundation. The purpose of the Project is to define an industry standard definition for application workload profiles and a standard set of measures and metrics that represent those profiles with the goal of developing an open source QA standard that replicates the above. The project may also develop a set of standardized tests that will validate and qualify platforms and infrastructure, which support the applications characterized by the profiles. These profiles will be represented as a set of Meta-Data elements that would describe the platform resource throughput requirements, security, regulatory, compliance, geographic constraints (risk) and financial objectives that a given application workload needs to operate within.  Finally, the Meta-Data model ideally would also capture technical and operation dependencies, constraints, relationships and hierarchy that the application workloads operates within.
